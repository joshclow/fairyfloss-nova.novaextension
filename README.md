Inspired by sailorhg's [lovely syntax theme](http://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/), with additional inspiration for the UI chrome pieces from mintchipleaf's [fairyfloss-complete](https://github.com/mintchipleaf/fairyfloss-vscode) for VSCode.

Install from the in-app extensions browser, or if you're using this as reference for your own theme, read up on how to get started [here](https://docs.nova.app)

[Nova](https://nova.app) is a coding editor by [Panic](https://panic.com), you should try it!
